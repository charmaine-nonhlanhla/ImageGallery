### 7.2 Configuration Steps
1. Clone the repository .
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and create a new database named `ImageGallery`.
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ImageGallery;
   ```
3. Configure connection strings in `appsettings.json` (API/Backend).
   ```json
   {
       "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=ImageGallery;Trusted_Connection=True;"
       }

   npm install
   ```
5. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
   cd api
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

## 8. Running the Application
